                <h3>Trying to Learn Everything at Once</h3>
                <p>
                    Beginners often try to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks,
                    and backend all together. This creates confusion and slows progress.
                    Focus on one thing at a time.

                <h3>Copy-Pasting Code Without Understanding</h3>
                <p>
                    Copying code from tutorials without understanding logic may work
                    temporarily, but it prevents real learning. Always try to understand
                    how and why code works.
